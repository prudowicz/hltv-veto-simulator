# hltv-veto-simulator
Userscript that adds veto simulator dialog at hltv match analytics summary

To use it install on your web browser Tempermonkey addon. Click on it's icon at addon bar and choose "Create new script...". Copy content of "userscript.js" file and paste it on opened editor. Next save it with CTRL + S keyboard shortcut. Veto simulator button will be showed at HLTV match page of analytics summary in "Map stats section". If you click on button you will see new dialog that allows you to choose which team will be first to ban and map selection for each pick. 
You should only select maps on 1st-ban-to-last-ban order. For example choosing a 1st-pick-map without banning maps before will break veto. To restart veto content simply click on veto simulator button again or switch first picking team. 

Hope it'll be useful!
